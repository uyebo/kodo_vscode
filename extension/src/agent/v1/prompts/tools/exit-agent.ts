I've installed the following dependencies:
- Jest
- Enzyme
- Axios
- React Testing Library

Here is the unit test output:
Test Suites: 3 passed,1 failed, 4 total
PASS src/components/App.test.js
PASS src/components/Header.test.js
PASS src/components/Footer.test.js
FAIL src/components/Profile.test.js - Expected 1, received 0 (I think this is related to the API call)
</result>
