# Claude Dev Agent System Overview

The Claude Dev agent system is a sophisticated software development assistant designed to handle various programming tasks. It consists of several interconnected components that work together to process user requests, execute tasks, and manage the system's state.

## Key Features

1. **Task Handling**: The system can process both new tasks and resume interrupted tasks from history.
2. **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Utilizes an AI model for decision-making and content generation.
3. **State Management**: Maintains conversation history and API request history for context.
4. **Tool Execution**: Capable of performing various operations like file manipulation, command execution, and web searches.
5. **Adaptive Execution**: Can iterate on tasks based on user feedback.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is built around several core components:

1. **KoduDev**: The central orchestrator of the entire system.
2. **ApiManager**: Handles communication with the AI model.
3. **StateManager**: Manages the system's state and history.
4. **TaskExecutor**: Breaks down and executes tasks.
5. **ToolExecutor**: Executes specific tools and operations.

These components work in concert to provide a flexible and powerful development assistant capable of tackling a wide range of programming challenges.
