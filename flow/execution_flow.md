# Claude Dev Agent System Execution Flow

This document outlines the execution flow of the Claude Dev agent system, from initial user input to final result presentation.

## 1. Initialization

1. The user provides a task or a history item to resume.
2. KoduDev is instantiated with necessary options.
3. StateManager is initialized with the initial state.
4. ApiManager is set up with the required API configurations.
5. ToolExecutor is initialized with the current working directory and permissions.
6. TaskExecutor is created and set up.

## 2. Task Start or Resume

- If it's a new task:
  1. KoduDev calls TaskExecutor to start the new task.
  2. The initial task details are added to the state.

- If it's a history item:
  1. KoduDev calls a method to resume the task from history.
  2. The saved state is loaded, including conversation history and task progress.

## 3. Task Processing

1. TaskExecutor breaks down the task into steps.
2. For each step:
   a. TaskExecutor may consult ApiManager to get AI-driven decisions.
   b. ApiManager sends a request to the AI model, including the system prompt and current context.
   c. The AI model provides a response, which ApiManager processes and returns to TaskExecutor.
   d. Based on the AI's response, TaskExecutor may:
      - Use ToolExecutor to perform specific actions (file operations, command execution, web searches, etc.)
      - Update the task state through StateManager
      - Move to the next step or iterate on the current step

## 4. Tool Execution

When a tool needs to be executed:
1. TaskExecutor calls ToolExecutor with the specific tool name and parameters.
2. ToolExecutor performs the requested action (e.g., reading a file, executing a command).
3. The result is returned to TaskExecutor.
4. TaskExecutor incorporates the result into the task flow and may update the state.

## 5. State Management

Throughout the process:
1. StateManager continuously updates the system's state.
2. This includes updating conversation history, API requests, and task progress.
3. The state is persisted, allowing for task resumption if interrupted.

## 6. Completion

1. Once TaskExecutor determines the task is complete, it notifies KoduDev.
2. KoduDev prepares the final result.
3. The result is presented to the user.

## 7. Feedback and Iteration (Optional)

If the user provides feedback:
1. KoduDev receives the feedback.
2. The feedback is passed to TaskExecutor.
3. TaskExecutor may iterate on the task, going back to step 3 (Task Processing) to make improvements.
4. This process continues until the user is satisfied or no further improvements can be made.

Throughout this flow, the system maintains flexibility to handle various types of tasks and adapt to user needs, all while leveraging the power of AI for decision-making and content generation.
